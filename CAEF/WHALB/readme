Calculate attributable excessive cancer risks given WHALB-predicted relative risks\

Requires the input of posterior parameter estimations from WHALB.  See https://github.com/zhengzhou0105/WHALB \
Allows integration with SLURM-based high performance computation.\
Allows mannual modification on the scenario of prediction.\

Default setting:
  Input dose: average daily dose for lifetime exposure of toxcicants from 0 to 5 $\mu$g/kg/day.\
  WHALB response: relative cancer risk
