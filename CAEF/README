Compare attributable cancer risk fractions calculated from cancer slope factor and WHALB relative risks

For WHALB, see repository: https://github.com/zhengzhou0105/WHALB

Aim: cancer risk estimates without imposing assumptions on the shape of dose-response curve at low dose. 

In this demonstration, relative risks weighted across hierarchical bayesian benchmark dose models were used. 
No assumption was placed on curve shape, i.e. prior model weights are equally distributed among candidate models.
