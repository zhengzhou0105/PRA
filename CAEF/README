WHALB is developed to address limitations in the traditional risk characterization approach.
Compare risk estimates from the traditional and the WHALB approach through the evaluation of attributable excessive risks

For WHALB, see repository: https://github.com/zhengzhou0105/WHALB

In this demonstration, relative risks weighted across hierarchical bayesian benchmark dose models were used. 
No assumption was placed on curve shape, i.e. prior model weights are equally distributed among candidate models.

Workflow: 
  1. get WHALB dose-response models: https://github.com/zhengzhou0105/WHALB
  2. get WHALB-based risk predictions: ./WHALB/
  3. get traditional-approach-based risk predictions: WHALB_AEF_analysis
  4. compare results from traditional and WHALB approaches
